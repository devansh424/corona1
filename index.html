  <p><i><br>About COVID-19:</font></i></p>
    <ul>

      <h3><li> During the initial outbreak in Wuhan, China, the virus and disease were commonly referred to as "coronavirus" and "Wuhan 
        coronavirus", with the disease sometimes called "Wuhan pneumonia". In the past, many diseases have been named after geographical 
        locations, such as the Spanish flu, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, and Zika virus. In January 2020, the WHO recommended 2019-
        nCov and 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease as interim names for the virus and disease per 2015 guidance and international 
        guidelines against using geographical locations (e.g. Wuhan, China), animal species, or groups of people in disease and virus
        names in part to prevent social stigma. The official names COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 were issued by the WHO on 11 February 2020.Tedros
        Adhanom explained: CO for corona, VI for virus, D for disease and 19 for when the outbreak was first identified (31 December 2019).
        The WHO additionally uses "the COVID-19 virus" and "the virus responsible for COVID-19" in public communications.</li><br>

      <li><font color="red">COVID-19 is caused by infection with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus 
        strain.</font></li><br>

      <li> The virus is transmitted mainly through the respiratory route after an infected person coughs, sneezes,
         sings, talks, or breathes. A new infection occurs when virus-containing particles exhaled by an infected person,
          either respiratory droplets or aerosols, get into the mouth, nose, or eyes of other people who are in close contact 
          with the infected person. During human-to-human transmission, an average 1000 infectious SARS-CoV-2 virions are thought 
          to initiate a new infection.</li><br>

      <li> The closer people interact, and the longer they interact, the more likely they are to transmit COVID-19.
         Closer distances can involve larger droplets (which fall to the ground) and aerosols, whereas longer distances only 
         involve aerosols. Larger droplets can also turn into aerosols (known as droplet nuclei) through evaporation. The relative 
         importance of the larger droplets and the aerosols is not clear as of November 2020; however, the virus is not known to 
         spread between rooms over long distances such as through air ducts. Airborne transmission is able to particularly occur 
         indoors, in high risk locations such as restaurants, choirs, gyms, nightclubs, offices, and religious venues, often when 
         they are crowded or less ventilated. It also occurs in healthcare settings, often when aerosol-generating medical procedures
          are performed on COVID-19 patients.</li><br></h3>

    <h3><li>From close contact (touching, shaking hands) with an infected person.</h3></li>

    <h3><li>By touching surfaces that the virus has landed on, then touching your eyes, mouth, or nose before washing your hands.
